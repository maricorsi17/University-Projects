**Title**: MBR (Membrane BioReactor): toxicity and micropollutants removal from wastewaters

**Description**:
- *Chapter one* - Membranes: features and filtering processes 
- *Chapter two* - Definition of toxicity and ecological risk and ecotoxicological methods description
- *Chapter three* - Data analysis
- *Conclusions* - Membrane BioReactors reduce toxicity and remove micropollutants better than conventional activated sludge reactors but they are economically non convenient. It is suggested to performe a **L**ife **C**ycle **A**ssessment before deciding whether to employ them or not.
